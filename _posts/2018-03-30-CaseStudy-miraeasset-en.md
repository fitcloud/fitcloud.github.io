- Through TCO analyzation, we achieved AWS TCO Calculator result indicating possible 91% cost reduction.
- Analyzation was done in Tokyo Region and Singapore Region.
- This is a 3 year TCO analyzation result. Even though there are price differences in On-premise server price of Seoul Region, we were able to come up with the discount rate shown in the result by adding operational manpower of the actual data center, electric charge, and extra expenses into the calculation.
- More discounts are expected due to the difference in charging methods when the peak of a certain instance exceeds the limit of the corresponding physical server. On-premise requires extra server purchase but AWS uses AutoScaling and charges costs on additionally established instances per second.
